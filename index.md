I am Xuning Hu, an undergraduate student at the University of Liverpool advised by [Prof. Hai-Ning Liang](https://cma.hkust-gz.edu.cn/people/hai-ning-liang/). My interests primarily focus on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computational Interaction. Specifically, I work on facilitating selection methods, text entry input, and modeling user behavior in XR (Extended Reality).

Currently, I am a research intern at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences under the supervision of [Prof. Jin Huang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~huangjin).

Prior to this, I collaborated with [Prof. Dominic Kao](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/profile/kaod) at Purdue University, [Prof. Wenge Xu](https://xuwenge.github.io/) at Birmingham City University, and Dr. Rajkumar Darbar at the X-CHI Lab, Centre national de la recherche scientifique, led by [Prof. Hai-Ning Liang](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/X-CHI-Lab-Hai-Ning-Liang).

I will complete my undergraduate studies in June 2026, and I am actively seeking RA/PhD positions in HCI (XR, user modeling). If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me. You can check my resume [here].
